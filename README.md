# I-hack

> Offensive Security meets AI â€” my personal collection of curated tools, research, methodologies, and payloads built during real hacking, bug bounty and AI experimentation.

##  About

This repository contains over a thousand resources and scripts carefully organized across categories I actively use in offensive security, red teaming, AI-assisted recon, and exploitation.

Inspired by the legendary [`h4cker`](https://github.com/The-Art-of-Hacking/h4cker) repo by Omar Santos â€” but built from my own experience and a bigger vision
